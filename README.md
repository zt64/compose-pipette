Supported platforms:

- JVM
- Android (minimum API level 21)
- Kotlin/JS
- Kotlin/WASM
- macOS (untested)
- iOS (untested)

## Styles

Compose-pipette comes with three different components for selecting colors: `CircularColorPicker`, `SquareColorPicker`
and `RingColorPicker`. Each component has a `thumb` parameter for passing a custom composable to be used for the thumb
component.

#### Circular Color Picker

The `CircularColorPicker` component is a simple circle that allows the user to select a color by dragging a point around
the
circle. The circle allows for control over the hue and saturation of the color.

```kotlin
var color by remember { mutableStateOf(HsvColor(Color.Red)) }

CircularColorPicker(
    color = { color },
    onColorChange = { color = it }
)
```

#### Square Color Picker

The `SquareColorPicker` component is a square that allows the user to select a color by dragging a point around the
square.
The square allows for control over the saturation and value of the color.

```kotlin
var color by remember { mutableStateOf(HsvColor(Color.Red)) }

SquareColorPicker(
    color = { color },
    onColorChange = { color = it },
    shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),
)
```

#### Ring Color Picker

The `RingColorPicker` component is a ring that allows the user to select a color by dragging a point around the ring.
Only the hue of the color can be changed with this component. For saturation control, use the `CircularColorPicker`
component.

```kotlin
var color by remember { mutableStateOf(HsvColor(Color.Red)) }

RingColorPicker(
    color = { color },
    onColorChange = { color = it }
)
```
